REST API that exposes the sum, subtraction, multiplication and division

It is necessary to run RabbitMQ on docker with this command: 
- `docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3.10-management`

To test the API you can use POSTMAN. Here is the link to import the collection that I used:
